#[Intel CPU comparison ðŸ”—](https://github.com/ExtraBinoss/Intel_Cpu_Comparaison)

---

## Goal of this project

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of different Intel processors. The data is scraped from the Intel website and stored in a database.

The user can then search for a processor and get a comparison of the performance of that processor with other processors.

It was made out of curiosity and to learn more about web scraping and databases.
